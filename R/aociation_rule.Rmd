we can see all the data on this website
import this library
```{r}
library(arules)
```
this means that it has 169 items
this is a 0-1 matrix
```{r}
data("Groceries")
summary(Groceries)
```
imformation of transaction 
```{r}
9835*169*0.02609146
Groceries
colnames(Groceries)[1:5]#all the item names
inspect(Groceries[1:5])
```
```{r}
rules<- apriori(Groceries,parameter = list(support = 0.001,confidence=0.5));rules
```
```{r}
(basketSize<- size(Groceries))
```

```{r}
inspect(rules[1:5])# the lift means that the probility of buying is notbuying 2.870009
```
how to convert a rules to the vector or the list?
if i can't use the normal method 
```{r}
rule
inspect(rules[1:5])
```
```{r}
class(rules)
```

```{r}
order_rules<- sort(rules,by="lift")
inspect(order_rules[1:5])
```
